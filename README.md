# Praxis LIVE Unoffcial Guide

This is an unofficial guide for PraxisLIVE that will help newcomers to manage
the software basics and to make it more accessible. It will also contain some
Processing nodes that will improve the software capabilities.

This project is developped by Giacomo Sabatini and Davide Riboli
at the Urbino Accademy of Fine Arts.
